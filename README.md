* To add a product to your shopping cart, select women or men from the menu below the big title and choose a category, then click the "buy" button
* When you add a product to your cart, the quantity of items in the shop will decrease
* When you add all items of one product to your cart, the product will be out of stock in the shop
* Out of stock items cannot be added to your cart
* To remove a product from your shopping cart, go to the shopping cart link in the navigation menu on the top right where you can see the number of items in your cart, then click the "remove" button
* When you remove a product from your cart, the quantity of items in the shop will increase as you return the items
* If you remove all items from your cart, a message "your cart is empty" will be displayed
* Total price will be displayed in the shopping cart (also with voucher discount)
* When you have items in your cart, you can use one of these vouchers: 

    - fancyClothes55 for £5.00 discount
    - fancyClothes66 for £10.00 discount if you the total price is more than £50.00
    - fancyClothes77 for £15.00 discount if you the total price is more than £75.00 and your cart contains at least 1 pair of shoes

* If you use an incorrect voucher ID a message will be diplayed
* You cannot use the same voucher twice
* To checkout the items from your cart, press the "checkout & pay" button which will clear your cart. Vouchers will be considered as used.
